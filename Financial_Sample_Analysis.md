### **Introduction:** 
This is a sample data gotten from the Microsoft website https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-financial-download, it's a demo dataset on which some analyses were done and visualization created using Power BI.

### **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
After downloading the dataset, some data preparation and cleaning was done to the dataset using Excel, they include: 
* removing blanks and duplicates in excel,
* data modelling was carried out on the data set, here I grouped similar data columns together, the aim of this is to appropriate link the realtionship between the data columns after it's uploaded to Power BI.

After the dataset was uploaded into power BI, a few DAX formulars was created, and the relationship between the data columns and tables were established

From the above report I was able to draw the following insights:

1. From the **Sales by product_category chart**; **General** had the highest Sales at $54m, and was 83.26% higher than Cosmetics which had the lowest Sales at 29.2m . 
**General** had the highest Sales at $54m, followed by **Household** at $35.9m and **Cosmetics** at $29.2m.  
General accounted for 45.08% of Sales.
   
2. **Sales** and **Total Profit** are positively correlated with each other. **Sales** and **Profit** diverged the most when the Month was October, when Sales were $18.2m higher than Profit. 

3. From the **Sales by Product** chart; Paseo and VTT generated the most sales with $33m and $21m, that is 28% and 18% of sales respectively; while Montana and Carratera from the Cosmetics product category has the least sales with $15m and $14m, that is 13% and 12% respectively
