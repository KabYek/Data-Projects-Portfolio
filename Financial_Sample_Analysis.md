**Introduction:** 
This is a sample data gotten from the Microsoft website https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-financial-download, it's a demo dataset on which some analyses were done and visualization created using Power BI.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
After downloading the dataset, some data preparation and cleaning was done to the dataset using Excel, they include: 
* removing blanks and duplicates in excel,
* data modelling was carried out on the data set, here I grouped similar data columns together, the aim of this is to appropriate link the realtionship between the data columns after it's uploaded to Power BI.

After the dataset was uploaded into power BI, a few DAX formulars was created, and the relationship between the data columns and tables were established
